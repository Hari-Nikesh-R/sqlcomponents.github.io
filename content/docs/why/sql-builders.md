SQL Builders will abstract all the connectiona management complexity from the user. For E.g while we use Spring JDBC Client, We should will have below item

All you will write is

Model Classes
Data Access Objects ( Using JDBC Clients )
RowMappers

```java
```

SQL Components will do the same functionality with better typesafe API.

```java
```

where Model, Data Access Objects and RowMappers will be automatically generated.
