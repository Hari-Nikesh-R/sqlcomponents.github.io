JPA will abstract all the connection management and also Dao complexity from the user. For E.g while we use Spring JPA , We should will have below item

All you will write is 

Model Classes
Data Access Objects ( Only Interface )


```java
```

SQL Components will do the same functionality with better typesafe API.

```java
```

where Model, Data Access Objects Interfaces will be automatically generated.
