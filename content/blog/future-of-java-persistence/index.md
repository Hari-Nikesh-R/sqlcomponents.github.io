Over the past two decades, the way we access relational databases from Java has evolved significantly. Starting with JDBC programming, we moved on to using SQL mappers and later adopted full-fledged ORM frameworks. However, modern architectures, such as cloud-native, microservices, and serverless, present new challenges that traditional persistence technologies may not fully address.

In this presentation, we will explore the history, theory, and technology behind the evolution of persistence technologies for Java applications. We will discuss the challenges posed by modern architectures and how cloud-native persistent technology can solve them. Join us to learn about the future of Java persistence and how you can prepare for it.
